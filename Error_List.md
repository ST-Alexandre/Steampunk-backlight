|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | ADC conversion failed. This could be due to incorrect configuration or hardware issues. |
| 2          | System clock configuration using `HAL_RCC_OscConfig` failed. This could be due to incorrect oscillator settings or hardware issues. |
| 3          | Enabling the over-drive mode using `HAL_PWREx_EnableOverDrive` failed. This could be due to power supply issues or incorrect configuration. |
| 4          | System clock configuration using `HAL_RCC_ClockConfig` failed. This could be due to incorrect clock settings or hardware issues. |
| 5          | Peripheral clock configuration using `HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig` failed. This could be due to incorrect peripheral clock settings or hardware issues. |
| 6          | PWM initialization using `HAL_TIM_PWM_Init` failed. This could be due to incorrect PWM settings or hardware issues. |
| 7          | PWM channel configuration using `HAL_TIM_PWM_ConfigChannel` failed. This could be due to incorrect channel settings or hardware issues. |
| 8          | Starting the PWM using `HAL_TIM_PWM_Start` failed. This could be due to incorrect start settings or hardware issues. |
| 9          | ADC initialization using `HAL_ADC_Init` failed. This could be due to incorrect ADC settings or hardware issues. |
| 10         | ADC channel configuration using `HAL_ADC_ConfigChannel` failed. This could be due to incorrect channel settings or hardware issues. |
